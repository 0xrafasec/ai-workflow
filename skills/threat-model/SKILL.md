description: "Create or update docs/THREAT_MODEL.md — a STRIDE-style design-level threat model with trust boundaries, attack surface, threats and mitigations. Use when the user asks for a threat model, an attack-surface analysis or a STRIDE pass, or says 'what could go wrong security-wise', 'identify the threats', 'lock this down before launch'. For reviewing a specific diff or branch, use the built-in /security-review instead."

Create or update the threat model. Argument: $ARGUMENTS (an optional focus area; update only that part and leave the rest)

## Context Gathering

Before interviewing, understand the system's security surface:

1. **Check for existing docs:**
   - Read `docs/THREAT_MODEL.md` — if revising, don't start from scratch
   - Read `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` for system structure and trust boundaries
   - Read the project's `CLAUDE.md` and `README.md`

2. **Survey the codebase** for auth, input handling, data access (raw SQL vs parameterized), secrets, exposed endpoints and service exposure (`docker-compose.yml`, deployment config).
3. Summarize what you found — "Here's what I see from a security perspective: ..."

## Interview

Use AskUserQuestion, asking only what the code and docs do not answer, in rounds of at most 3-4 questions. If the user cannot be asked (a headless run), write from what exists and list each assumption as an open question.

1. **Trust boundaries** — What is trusted? What is untrusted? Where are the boundaries?
2. **Authentication** — How do users/agents/services prove identity? What mechanisms exist today?
3. **Authorization** — Who can do what? How are permissions modeled?
4. **Sensitive data** — What data is sensitive? Credentials, PII, financial? Where does it live? How is it protected at rest and in transit?
5. **Attack surface** — What is exposed to the internet? To local users? To other services? What inputs does the system accept?
6. **Threat actors** — Who would attack this? Script kiddies, insiders, nation states? What are their capabilities?
7. **Compliance** — Any regulatory requirements? SOC2, GDPR, HIPAA, PCI? (skip if none apply)
8. **Existing security measures** — What's already in place? What's missing?

For inherited projects: "I see you're using X for auth — is that intentional or legacy? I notice Y has no input validation — is that a known gap?"

## Write

Write to `docs/THREAT_MODEL.md`:

# Threat Model

**Last updated:** [date]

## Trust Assumptions

[What is the trust model? What is trusted, what is untrusted? Include a Mermaid diagram of the trust hierarchy.]

## Security Properties

[Non-negotiable security invariants. Things that must always hold.]

- [Property 1]
- [Property 2]

## Attack Surface

| Surface | Exposure | Controls |
|---------|----------|----------|
| [surface] | [who can reach it] | [what protects it] |

## Threats

[Walk each trust boundary and data flow through S/T/R/I/D/E (spoofing, tampering, repudiation, information disclosure, denial of service, elevation of privilege); omit categories that do not apply. If a control cannot be confirmed from the code, mark it `unverified`, never `implemented`.]

### [Component or flow]

| # | STRIDE | Attack | Impact | Likelihood | Defense | Status |
|---|--------|--------|--------|------------|---------|--------|
| 1 | [S/T/R/I/D/E] | [attack description] | [what happens] | [Low/Med/High] | [how it's prevented] | [implemented / unverified / missing] |

## Sensitive Data Inventory

| Data | Classification | At Rest | In Transit | Access Control |
|------|---------------|---------|------------|----------------|
| [data type] | [level] | [protection] | [protection] | [who can access] |

## Gaps (not yet implemented)

- [Control — what it protects against — priority]

## Compliance Requirements

[Only if applicable. Regulatory frameworks, what they require, current status.]
```

## After Writing

1. Present the document to the user for review. Iterate until they're satisfied.
2. Suggest next steps based on what exists:
   - No architecture doc? → "Define system structure with `/wf:architecture`"
   - Ready to build? → "Create feature specs with `/wf:spec <name>`, then `/wf:roadmap`"
3. Remind the user that security-sensitive PRs still need `/security-review`; this document is its input, not a substitute.
