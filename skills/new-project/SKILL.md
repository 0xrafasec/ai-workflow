description: "Scaffold a new project directory for a chosen stack: git init, a CLAUDE.md with the real build and test commands, a Makefile with test and lint targets, a lint-on-edit hook, a .gitignore, secret scanning and the docs/ skeleton the other /wf skills write into.

Scaffold a new project: `$ARGUMENTS` is `<project-name> [language/framework]`, e.g. `my-api python/fastapi`, `my-cli go`, `my-app typescript/nextjs`.

Generate only what you can name a working command for. If a tool for the stack is uncertain, leave it out and say so in the summary. Never write a bracketed placeholder into a generated file.

## Process

### 1. Check the target and the stack

- The project goes in `$PWD/<project-name>/`. If that directory exists and is not empty, stop and ask the user to confirm before touching it. Even when confirmed, never overwrite an existing file: skip it and list what you skipped.
- If no stack was given, ask one AskUserQuestion for stack and project type (API, CLI, library, web app). Take the test runner, linter and formatter from `references/stacks.md`. If you cannot ask, stop with a one-line error instead of guessing a stack.

### 2. Initialize

```bash
mkdir -p <project-name> && cd <project-name> && git init
mkdir -p docs/specs docs/roadmap docs/adr
touch docs/specs/.gitkeep docs/roadmap/.gitkeep docs/adr/.gitkeep
```

The `wf` plugin provides the workflow skills; do not copy them into the project.

### 3. Tooling

Read `references/stacks.md` for the chosen stack, then create:

- **`Makefile`** with `test`, `lint`, `lint-changed` (lint only changed files; exit 0 when nothing changed or the repo has no commits), plus `typecheck` and `build` only where the stack has them.
- **`.gitignore`** for the stack, always including `.claude/settings.local.json` (personal overrides; `.claude/settings.json` is committed), `.env` and `.env.*` with `!.env.example`.
- **`.pre-commit-config.yaml`** with the stack's formatter/linter and gitleaks. Look up gitleaks' current release tag (`git ls-remote --tags https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks`) for `rev`; never write a guessed one. Keep tests out of pre-commit.
- **`.claude/settings.json`**, so lint failures reach Claude. A `PostToolUse` hook only does that when it exits 2 and writes to stderr:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PostToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Edit|Write",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "out=$(make lint-changed 2>&1) || { printf '%s\\n' \"$out\" | head -20 >&2; exit 2; }"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### 4. CLAUDE.md

Write a short `CLAUDE.md` with only what is true of this project: the `make` commands that exist in the Makefile you generated, the code-style points Claude tends to get wrong for this stack, and a one-line architecture note. Leave out a section you cannot fill. Do not copy the user's global workflow rules (commit style, review, security review); they apply in every project. End with: "Features start from a spec in `docs/specs/`; see `/wf:spec`."

### 5. Verify

Run `make lint` and `make test` once. Each should exit 0 on the empty scaffold; if one does not, fix the target or say why. If the stack's toolchain is not installed, scaffold anyway and list what to install.

### 6. Commit and summarize

Make the initial commit on the trunk branch with the subject `chore: scaffold project`. Tell the user what was created and what was skipped, then suggest next steps:
1. `pre-commit install` (after `pipx install pre-commit` if needed)
2. `/wf:prd <project-name>`, then `/wf:architecture` (until it exists, `/wf:feature` and `/wf:fix` infer the testing strategy from the code)
3. `/wf:threat-model` if applicable
4. `/wf:spec <first-feature>`, then `/wf:feature <first-feature>`
