description: "File GitHub milestones and issues from a roadmap, a phase file or a spec — one milestone per phase, one issue per task or slice — then write the issue numbers back into the docs so /wf:feature and /wf:autopilot can name branches and close issues. Safe to re-run: reconciles issues already filed. Use when the user says 'create the GitHub issues', 'file the issues for this roadmap', 'open issues for this spec', 'make the milestones', or points at docs/roadmap or docs/specs and wants them on GitHub."

File GitHub milestones and issues for: $ARGUMENTS

## What this skill does

`/wf:issues` is the hand-off between planning artifacts (`docs/roadmap/*.md`, `docs/specs/*.md`) and GitHub. It files:

- **One milestone per phase:** `Phase NNN — <phase-name>`
- **One issue per task/slice:** title `[NNN.N] <task-name>` for a roadmap task, `[NNN.N.N] <slice-name>` for a slice of a roadmap task, `[<feature>.NNN] <slice-name>` for a standalone spec's slice. `N` in `[NNN.N]` is the task's position in its phase (Task 2 gives `[003.2]`), not the letter suffix of the spec file.
- **Labels:** `type:<type>`, `complexity:<low|med|high>`, `mvp` or `post-mvp` (if derivable), `needs-spec` if the spec file does not exist yet.
- **Body:** spec link, file list, dependencies, verification command, flag, acceptance criteria from the spec.

It then writes the issue numbers back into the source docs (see Writeback).

## Parse arguments

- **Roadmap index** (`docs/roadmap/README.md`): everything: a milestone per phase file, an issue per task, an issue per slice where a task points at a sliced spec.
- **Phase file** (`docs/roadmap/NNN_<phase>.md`): one milestone plus its tasks (and slices).
- **Sliced spec index** (`docs/specs/NNN_<feature>/README.md`): one issue per Slices row. Uses the feature's existing milestone if the spec references a phase, otherwise no milestone.
- **Single spec** (`docs/specs/NNN_<feature>.md`): one issue; a milestone only if the spec references a phase.

No argument: use `docs/roadmap/README.md`; if it is missing but `docs/roadmap/NNN_*.md` exist, offer those; otherwise ask.

## Transport: `gh` CLI

Every read and write goes through `gh`. Run `gh auth status` once at the start; if it fails, tell the user to run `gh auth login` (their call) and stop. Milestones have no `gh milestone` command, so use `gh api "repos/{owner}/{repo}/milestones"` (list with `?state=all&per_page=100 --paginate`, create with `-f title=... -f description=...`). Create issues with `gh issue create --title ... --body-file <tmp> --milestone "..." --label "..."`; the body goes through a file so Markdown and backticks survive.

## Asking the user

Use `AskUserQuestion` at each decision point: structured options are unambiguous where "ok"/"go" is not. First option is the recommendation; "Other" means the user is correcting you, so re-plan. Batch decisions needed back-to-back into one call.

- **Reconcile** (drifted or closed issues found): Update in place (recommended) / Close + refile / Skip.
- **Horizon** (roadmap index only): Current + next phase (recommended) / Full roadmap.
- **Proceed?** (dry-run confirmation): Yes / Cancel.
- **Next phase** (after each milestone batch, only when the user chose Full roadmap): Yes, continue / Stop here.

If `AskUserQuestion` is unavailable (headless run, or dispatched by `/wf:autopilot` with the plan already approved), do not file anything on your own: print the dry-run plan and stop, unless the caller said the plan is approved.

## Preflight

1. **`gh auth status`** (above). Stop if it fails.
2. **Confirm a GitHub remote:** `gh repo view --json nameWithOwner` must succeed (this also covers GitHub Enterprise). If not, stop.
3. **Read the source file(s) top to bottom.** Collect `Type`, `Complexity`, `Flag`, `Depends on`, `Spec` and the existing `Issue` / `Issues` values from the Tasks and Slices tables and Trunk Metadata.
4. **Detect already-filed issues.**
   - For each row with a `#<N>`, run `gh issue view`. Classify it `match` (aligned with the source), `drift` (title, labels, milestone or body need an update) or `gone` (closed or deleted).
   - For rows with no `Issue` value, search open and closed issues by title prefix (`gh issue list --state all --search "[003.2] in:title"`). Adopt a match instead of creating a duplicate: a previous run may have died between creating the issue and the writeback.
   - Print `X rows already filed: Y match / Z drift / W gone`, then ask the **Reconcile** question. If the user names specific rows under "Other", re-plan per row.
5. **Fetch existing milestones** and match them against the phase titles so reruns are idempotent.
6. **Dry-run.** Print everything that will be created or changed (milestones, issues with title, labels and milestone, writebacks) and ask **Proceed?**. A free-text "ok" does not count; wait for the structured answer. For a roadmap index, batch it with **Horizon**.

## Milestone shape

- **Title:** `Phase NNN — <phase-name>`, from the phase file's `# Phase NNN: <name>` heading or the task's `Milestone:` field.
- **Description:** the phase's `## Context` paragraph, truncated to ~500 chars.
- **Due date:** skip unless the phase file names one.

## Issue shape

**Labels:**

- `type:<type>` from the `Type` field (`feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `chore`, `test`, `docs`, `perf`, `security`).
- `complexity:low` / `complexity:med` / `complexity:high` from `Complexity`.
- `mvp` or `post-mvp` from the roadmap index's MVP column; omit when not derivable.
- `needs-spec` if the task's spec file does not exist yet.

Create missing labels on first run (`gh label list --limit 200 --json name`, then `gh label create "<name>" --color <hex>`). Colors: `type:feat` `1d76db`, `type:fix` `d73a4a`, `type:refactor` `a2eeef`, `type:chore` `cccccc`, `type:test` `0e8a16`, `type:docs` `0075ca`, `type:perf` `fbca04`, `type:security` `b60205`; `complexity:low` `c2e0c6`, `complexity:med` `fef2c0`, `complexity:high` `f9d0c4`; `mvp` `0e8a16`, `post-mvp` `cfd3d7`, `needs-spec` `e99695`.

**Body template:**

```markdown
## Context
<one-paragraph summary from the task's Context or the spec's Problem>

## Spec
- File: [<path>](<path>)
- Trunk metadata: type=<type>, flag=<flag>, complexity=<complexity>

## Files
<bullet list of files from the task's Files field>

## Dependencies
<`None.` or `Blocked by #<N>[, #<N>...].`>

## Verification
```
<verification command from the spec>
```

## Acceptance Criteria
<Verification Criteria bullets from the spec, each as a `- [ ]` item>

## Feature Flag
<flag name and default, or `None — slice is user-ready on merge`>

---
Filed by `/wf:issues` from `<source-file>`.
```

## Dependencies

File issues in dependency order. Roadmap order already puts dependencies first, and `/wf:spec` forbids a slice depending on an unmerged slice. Each body then names the real `#N` of an already-filed blocker. A dependency already filed earlier is looked up in the source docs' `Issue` / `Issues` values. If a dependency points forward (to something not yet filed), stop and fix the source ordering.

**Never write the source's `001`, `002`, ... as `#001` in a body.** GitHub auto-links `#N` to the issue with that number, so `#001` silently points at issue #1, not the slice you meant.

## Pacing: two-phase horizon

For a roadmap index spanning many phases, default to filing only the current phase and the next. Issues are the short-range artifact and the roadmap is the long-range one; filing 50 issues up front just rots into stale labels and half-done milestones. Phase and single-spec inputs are already scoped and skip this.

1. **Current phase:** the first phase whose Status is not `Completed`, or whose tasks don't all have `Issue` values.
2. **Next phase:** the phase after it in the index.
3. The dry-run files only those two and lists the skipped phases ("Phases 004–009 stay in docs/roadmap/ for now; re-run `/wf:issues` when you're ready for the next wave").
4. Ask **Horizon**. If the user picks Full roadmap, drop the cap and warn about the label-rot cost.

Re-running later is idempotent on filed phases and picks up the next window.

## Execution: one milestone at a time

For roadmap and phase inputs, file one milestone and its issues at a time, in roadmap order, so a broken run is recoverable and writebacks stay atomic per phase. Write each `#N` back into the source right after its issue is created, so an interrupted run does not leave an issue the source does not know about. After each batch, print the milestone and issue URLs. When the user chose Full roadmap, ask **Next phase** and halt unless they continue; otherwise move on to the next phase in the horizon. Single-spec inputs: file, write back, done.

## Writeback

Update the source Markdown with `Edit` (exact-string replace), preserving surrounding formatting:

- **Roadmap task:** `- **Issues:** —` becomes `- **Issues:** #<N>` (or `#<N>, #<N+1>, ...` for a sliced task).
- **Roadmap task with a single-file spec:** also write `#<N>` to the spec's Trunk Metadata `**Issue:**` line, because `/wf:feature` and `/wf:autopilot` read it there.
- **Roadmap task with a sliced spec:** write each slice's `#<N>` to the Slices table `Issue` column and list them all in the roadmap's `Issues:`.
- **Standalone sliced spec:** `#<N>` in the Slices table `Issue` column.
- **Standalone single spec:** `- **Issue:** — (filled by `/wf:issues`)` becomes `- **Issue:** #<N>`.

A row updated in place (not newly filed) keeps its existing `Issue` value.

## Idempotency

- Re-running on a fully filed source is a no-op: the dry-run shows 0 creates, 0 updates.
- Rows hand-closed on GitHub are `gone`; offer refile or skip.
- Spec edits since filing show up as `drift` on the affected rows.
- Never delete issues; close them with a pointer comment (`gh issue close <N> --comment "..."`).

## After writing

1. Print a summary: milestones created, issues created, issues updated, with URLs.
2. Say which phases were filed and which stayed in the roadmap, and when to re-run to advance the window.
3. Suggest the next step: `/wf:feature docs/specs/NNN_<name>.md` (or a slice file `docs/specs/NNN_<name>/MMM_<slice>.md`) for one task, or `/wf:autopilot docs/roadmap/NNN_<phase>.md` for a whole phase. When a phase finishes, `/wf:autopilot` marks it `Completed`; re-run `/wf:issues docs/roadmap/README.md` to advance the window.
