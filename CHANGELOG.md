## [Unreleased]

## [0.5.5] - 2026-04-18

### Fixed
- `/spec` — collapsed the three restatements of the `NNN`-prefix rule (Hard Requirements, Spec Numbering, Slice section) into one **Spec Numbering & Path** section, and the two copies of the trunk-metadata field definitions (Slices table columns + single-file `## Trunk Metadata` block) into one shared subsection. Same rules, stated once each.
- `/issues` — dependency references in issue bodies now use `{{issue:<slice-id>}}` placeholders during creation and get rewritten to real `#N` values in a second pass once the `slice-id → #N` mapping is known. Writing raw `#001`, `#002` during creation auto-linked those tokens to whatever issues already existed in the repo (issue #1, #2, …), silently producing wrong cross-references. The per-milestone loop now runs pass 2 before writing back to source spec files so downstream references use final issue numbers.

## [0.5.4] - 2026-04-18

### Fixed
- `/spec` now prefixes every spec with a zero-padded `NNN` that mirrors the roadmap phase number (`docs/specs/002_jira-sync.md`), with `.A`/`.B` letter suffixes when a phase has multiple specs. Sliced specs use the directory form `docs/specs/NNN_<feature>/` with `README.md` + `MMM_<slice>.md` inside — the directory itself is how "sliced" is identified, no extra marker. Previously spec filenames carried no ordering signal, so reading `docs/specs/` gave no hint which came first or how specs mapped back to roadmap phases. `/roadmap`, `/feature`, and `/issues` updated to reference the new prefixed paths.

## [0.5.3] - 2026-04-18

### Fixed
- `/feature` and `/fix` no longer commit, push, or open PRs — both stop after implementation, verification, and self-review with a structured report (files changed, lint/typecheck/test tail, security verdict, slice metadata, suggested commit subjects). The previous `--pr` flag and auto-commit step quietly turned every run into a shipped PR before the user had a chance to read the diff; the user reviews the working tree, then ships via `/commit` + `/pr`. Orchestrators (`/autopilot`, `/factory`) keep their auto-commit/PR behavior — that is where it earns its keep.
- `/feature` `Asking the user questions` rule now requires the `AskUserQuestion` tool for every mid-flight decision (missing spec, slice-size override, split shape, ambiguous metadata) — free-text prompts were ambiguous to parse and easy to skip.

### Changed
- Canonical feature flow in `CLAUDE.md` now reads: `/spec → (slice if >200 lines) → /issues → /feature <spec> → review the diff → /commit → /pr → /review → merge → cleanup`.
- `docs/TRUNK_BASED_WORKFLOW.md` and `docs/REFERENCE.md` recipes updated to drop `--pr` from `/feature` and `/fix`.

## [0.5.2] - 2026-04-18

### Fixed
- `/issues` now uses the `AskUserQuestion` tool for every interactive decision — drift/gone reconciliation, dry-run confirmation, roadmap-index horizon, and the per-milestone "proceed to next phase?" loop. Free-text confirmations were easy to miss and ambiguous to parse ("ok", "sure", "go"); structured options make each decision one click with an explicit recommended default, and batch the horizon + dry-run prompts into a single call on roadmap-index runs.

## [0.5.1] - 2026-04-18

### Added
- `/issues` — **two-milestone horizon** as the default pacing recommendation for roadmap-index inputs. The skill now proposes filing only the current phase + the next phase (not the entire roadmap), names the phases it's skipping, and asks before filing more. Rolling forward is idempotent: re-running advances the window once phases complete. This is the team practice that translates cleanly to solo work — it gives team discipline (issue-per-PR, milestone-scoped) without team overhead (stale labels, quarter-long backlogs, triage meetings).

### Changed
- `/issues` "After writing" guidance now reinforces the horizon: when the current phase is roughly halfway done, re-run to file the next-next phase.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-04-18

### Added
- `/issues` skill — files GitHub milestones (one per phase) and issues (one per task/slice) from `docs/roadmap/*.md` and `docs/specs/*.md`. Polymorphic input: a roadmap index, a single phase, a sliced spec's `README.md`, or a single-file spec. Uses the GitHub MCP as the primary transport with `gh` CLI as a fallback. Per-milestone confirmation loop keeps broken runs recoverable. Writes issue numbers back into the source Markdown so `/feature` can derive branch names.
- Label taxonomy bootstrapped on first `/issues` run: `type:feat|fix|refactor|chore|test|docs|perf|security`, `complexity:low|med|high`, `mvp|post-mvp`, `needs-spec|spec-ready|blocked`, each with a default color.

### Changed
- `/spec` now emits a trunk-aware Slices table with `Type`, `Flag`, `Depends on`, `Complexity`, and `Issue` columns — the table is the source of truth for `/issues`. Single-file specs get a `## Trunk Metadata` block with the same fields so `/issues` can file them too.
- `/roadmap` tasks now carry `Type`, `Feature flag`, `Milestone`, and `Issues` fields. `complexity:high` tasks must point at a sliced directory-form spec (one PR per slice). Phase template gains a `## Trunk Alignment` section naming flags and shipping state.
- `/feature` derives branch names from the spec's `Issue` field — canonical form is `<type>/<issue-number>-<slug>` (e.g., `feat/42-jira-sync`). Falls back to `<type>/<slug>` when no issue is filed yet. PR body now requires `Closes #<N>` and a `Feature flag` line matching the spec.
- Canonical feature flow in `CLAUDE.md` now reads: `/spec → (slice if >200 lines) → /issues → /feature <spec> --pr → /review → merge → cleanup`.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-04-18

### Added
- `docs/TRUNK_BASED_WORKFLOW.md` — full guide explaining the shift from Git Flow to trunk-based development, why it fits AI-assisted work, the seven rules, skill-enforcement table, recipes, and FAQ.
- `Trunk-Based Workflow` section in global `CLAUDE.md` codifying branch naming (`feat/*`, `fix/*`, `refactor/*`, `docs/*`, `chore/*`, `test/*`, `perf/*`, `security/*`), short-lived branches, ≤200-line slices, feature-flag expectations, worktree placement, and delete-after-merge.
- Slicing step in `/spec`: when a feature is estimated >200 lines, produces sub-specs under `docs/specs/<feature>/NNN_<slice>.md` with an index `README.md` and per-slice feature-flag section.
- `## Feature Flag` section in the single-file spec template.
- Branch precondition + slice-size gate in `/feature` and `/fix` (blocks commits when `git diff --stat` exceeds ~200 lines; requires explicit user override).
- Branch-name validation, diff-size warning, and post-merge cleanup reminder in `/pr`.

### Changed
- `PR Structure` in `CLAUDE.md` now cross-references the new Trunk-Based Workflow section for slicing and feature-flag rules.
- `docs/REFERENCE.md` overview now points at `TRUNK_BASED_WORKFLOW.md` alongside `WORKFLOW.md`.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-04-18

### Added
- `extras/` opt-in tree with `--extra` flag on `install.sh` for personal add-ons that stay outside the core workflow.
- `/rlabs-design` as the first extra — personal brand design system (tokens, typography, assets, UI kits, preview cards). Installed only when `./install.sh --extra` is passed.

### Changed
- Project-wide docs moved from `docs/specs/` to `docs/` root: `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `TECHNICAL_DESIGN_DOCUMENT.md`, and `THREAT_MODEL.md`. `docs/specs/` is now reserved for individual feature specs only.
- All skill references updated accordingly across `architecture`, `tdd`, `security`, `adr`, `rfc`, `spec`, `roadmap`, `design`, `autopilot`, `feature`, `fix`, `review` skills, plus `README.md` and `docs/REFERENCE.md`.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-04-15

### Added
- Multi-platform support: Cursor and OpenAI Codex CLI adapters alongside Claude Code (`aiwf install-cursor`, `aiwf install-codex`, `aiwf install-all`).
- `/design` skill for producing distinctive, production-grade UI designs via the Paper.design MCP, including multi-hue palette and accessibility guidance.
- `/verify-design` skill — diffs the running UI against Paper refs with Playwright and fixes mismatches in place.
- `/factory` skill — end-to-end delivery pipeline that reads the roadmap, generates specs, and runs parallel `/feature` agents.
- `/commit` and `/pr` skills for splitting the working tree into logical conventional commits and opening pull requests.
- Roadmap skill now requires an MVP boundary in every full roadmap and numbers phase files with a `001_` prefix.
- Verification, UI work, file convention, and git workflow sections added to the global `CLAUDE.md`.

### Changed
- `/feature` skill rewritten (v2) with benchmark-driven trims.
- `/design` skill pushed toward distinctive aesthetic commitments.
- Skill descriptions polished, guardrails reframed, and model guidance added across the suite.
- Enabled 8 additional `claude-plugins-official` plugins in `settings.json`.
- `WORKFLOW.md` and `REFERENCE.md` moved under `docs/`.

### Deprecated
- In-repo `/code-review` skill deprecated in favor of Anthropic's official `code-review` skill from `claude-code-plugins` (benchmark showed no detection lift at ~1.5× the cost). Language-specific review guides in `reviews/` remain in use by `/review`, `/feature`, and `/fix`.

### Fixed
- Codex adapter: install skills as native Codex skills under `~/.agents/skills/aiwf-*/`, write `AGENTS.md` (not `instructions.md`), and raise `project_doc_max_bytes` so `AGENTS.md` is not truncated.

### Documentation
- README and `REFERENCE.md` updated for multi-platform support.
- References refreshed for `/design`, `/verify-design`, and `/factory`; review-layer diagram fixed.
- Bare `code-review` references disambiguated as Anthropic's skill.
- Codex invocation clarified as `$<name>` with symlink layout documented.
