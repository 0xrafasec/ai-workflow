# AI Workflow Uninstaller
# Removes symlinks created by install.sh and restores backups if they exist.
# The plugin itself is removed with `claude plugin uninstall wf@ai-workflow`.
#
# CLAUDE_DIR selects which Claude config dir to clean (default ~/.claude), and
# must match the one install.sh was run against. Only symlinks that point into
# this clone are removed, so a profile that kept its own settings.json
# (install.sh --no-settings), or links it to its own dotfiles, is left untouched.

# Resolve a directory to its canonical form so that ~/.claude, ~/.claude/,
# ~/./.claude and a symlinked ~/.claude all compare equal. The primary-dir
# comparison below decides whether settings.json is shared, so a spelling
# difference must never flip it.
